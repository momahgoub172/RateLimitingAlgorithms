# RateLimitingAlgorithms
- This repository contains the implementation of various rate limiting algorithms in C#.
- Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of traffic sent or received by a network interface controller and is used to prevent DoS attacks.
- The repository contains the following rate limiting algorithms:
  - Token Bucket
  - Leaky Bucket
  - Fixed Window
  - Sliding Window

 
- Example : Bucket contains 7 tokens and refil rate is token per second
